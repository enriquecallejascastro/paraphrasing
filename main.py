context = "The highlight of this study is that the same light-weight model trained by keeping the objective of Paraphrase Generation can also be used for solving the Paraphrase Identification task. Hence, the proposed system islight-weight in terms of the modelâ€™s size along with the data used to train the model which facilitates the quick learning of the model without having to compromise with the results."
